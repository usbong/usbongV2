### 3.2 Deutschland System of Pension Insurance:
"The statutory pension insurance is the most important pillar of old-age provisions. Its financing is split: The monthly contributions paid by employees and employers pay the pensions of those currently in retirement. Through their contributions, those insured acquire some rights when they themselves become pensioners. In turn, coming generations provide for these future rents with their contributions (<b>cross-generational contract</b>). In addition, company and private pensions are the second and third pillars of provisions for old age. Under certain conditions these also enjoy government support."<br/>
